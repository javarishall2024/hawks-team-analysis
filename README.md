# hawks-team-analysis

An Atlanta Hawks analytics project using possession-adjusted metrics, Four Factors, and linear regression modeling to predict win totals from 2021 to 2024.

## 📊 Project Overview

This analysis leverages publicly available NBA box score data via the `hoopR` package to:

- Calculate team-level possession-adjusted Four Factors
- Compare the Hawks' metrics to league averages
- Create a linear regression model to predict wins
- Evaluate accuracy using RMSE, MAE, and R²
- Visualize actual vs predicted win totals

## 📁 Files Included

- `hawks_project_full_analysis_updated.R` – Final cleaned R script with modeling, visualizations, and accuracy metrics
- `Atlanta Hawks Project.R` – Original development script
- `Assignment 2 Option B - Team Construction and Player Types - Hall, Javaris.docx` – Word report on team construction, archetypes, and offseason strategy

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Hawks underperformed relative to expected wins in 2024 based on shooting and turnover metrics
- FT rate improved but wasn’t enough to offset shooting and possession efficiency decline
- Recommended player types: rim-protecting bigs, off-ball wings with high eFG%, and low-turnover facilitators

## 🔧 Tools Used

- R
- hoopR
- dplyr, tidyr, janitor, ggplot2
